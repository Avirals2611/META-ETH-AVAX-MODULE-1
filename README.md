Project Title
Metacrafters' assessment of Module 1 for the ETH-AVAX Course.

Description
This assessment is for a module in a course named Eth-AVAX-Proof, offered by Metacrafters, a learn-and-earn platform that supports multiple blockchains. During this class, we gained knowledge on various blockchain ideas and began exploring the world of blockchain and Avalanche by first establishing a base in Solidity and Avalanche.


Getting Started
Installing
   *Visit remix.ethereum.org, an online code editor specifically designed for Solidity by Ethereum.
    *Please access requireRevertAssert.sol file available in this repository.
   *Replicate the code.
   *The preparation is finished and you are ready to start.

   
Executing Program
Once everything is prepared
   *Compile the program with the Solidity compiler found in the sidebar (or use CTRL + S).
   *If you observe a green check mark in the sidebar, it indicates that your program ran without any errors.
   *Implement the program.
   * Go ahead and run all the functions/methods that are included in the contract.

     
Help
   *You can use CTRL + S to compile.
   *Require, revert, and assert are used in Solidity for error handling.
   *Require takes 2 arguments in general - a condition and a string. If the condition is true, then it will continue further execution, and if it is false, it will 
    revert the change.
   *Revert generally takes one argument, which is a string, and that is displayed whenever the code is reverted. It is commonly used with if-else blocks.
   *Assert also takes 1 argument, which is a condition. If the condition is true, then it will continue further execution; otherwise, it will revert.
   *Reverting the code means that it will undo every change made by that function in the state variables.
   *Assert is generally used for bug checking and security purposes.
