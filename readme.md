Project Title
Metacrafters assessment of module 1 for ETH-AVAX Course

Description
This is the assessment for a module of a course called Eth-AVAX-Proof provided to us by Metacrafters which is a multichain learn and earn platform. In this course, we learned about different blockchain concepts and started our journey in field of blockchain and Avalanche by laying the foundation in solidity and avalanche.

Getting Started
Installing
  * Open remix.ethereum.org (a online code editor for solidity by ethereum)
  * Open requireRevertAssert.sol given in this repository.
  * Copy the code
  * Now, set up is complete and you are good to go.
Executing Program
  After set up
  * Compile the program by using solidity compiler given in the sidebar (or you can use CTRL + S).
  * In the sidebar, if you get green check mark, this means your program executed successfully.
  * Deploy the program
  * Run and execute all the function/method which is present in the contract
Help
  * You can use CTRL + S to compile
  * require ,revert and assert are used in solidity for error handling
  * require takes 2 argument in general - a condition and a string. if condition is true then it will do further execution and if it is false it will revert the change.
  * revert generally takes one argument which is a string and that is displayed whenever the code is reverted. It is generally used with if-else block.
  * assert also takes 1 argument which is a condition: if the condition is true then it will do further execution else it will revert.
  * Reverting the code means it will undo every change done by that function in the state variables.
  * assert generally used for bug checking and security purposes.
