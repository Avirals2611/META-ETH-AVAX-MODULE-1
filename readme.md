# Project Title
Metacrafters assessment of Module 1 for ETH-AVAX Course

## Description
This is the evaluation for a section of a program named Eth-AVAX-Proof offered by Metacrafters, a multi-chain educational platform that allows users to earn while learning. In this class, we covered various blockchain ideas and began exploring the world of blockchain and Avalanche by establishing a base in Solidity and Avalanche.

## Getting Started
### Installing
      * Visit remix.ethereum.org, an online Solidity code editor provided by Ethereum.
      * Access the requireRevertAssert.sol file available in this repository.
      * Duplicate the code.
      * The setup is now finished and you are ready to start.
      
### Executing Program
      After set up
      * Build the program with the Solidity compiler found in the sidebar, or use CTRL + S.
      * If you see a green checkmark in the sidebar, it indicates that your program ran without any issues.
      * Implement the program.
      * Carry out and implement all functions/methods included in the contract.

## Help
      * Pressing CTRL + S allows you to compile.
      * In Solidity, require, revert, and assert are employed for managing errors.
      * In general, require typically requires two arguments - a condition and a string. If the statement is correct, it will continue with additional actions; if it is incorrect, it will undo the modification.
      * Revert typically requires one parameter, a string shown when the code is reverted. It is commonly utilized in conjunction with if-else statements.
      * Assert requires 1 argument, a condition: if the condition is true, execution will continue; otherwise, it will revert.
      * Undoing the code will reverse all modifications done by the function on the state variables.
      * Typically, Assert is utilized for bug verification and security reasons.
